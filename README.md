The goal of this project is to create a visualization and creation studio for guitar tablature. The application will allow users to create new guitar tabs from scratch, as well as ease the currently tedious process of creation. The user will also be able to view tabs in the application and be able to auto-scroll the tabs at a set rate along to a metronome. After creating a tab, the user will be able to export their work to an internet-friendly format, similar to the format seen on websites such as www.Ultimate-Guitar.com.
